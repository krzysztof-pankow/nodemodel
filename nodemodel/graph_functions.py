    """
    Constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) representing the relationships between node functions and their dependencies.

    The function creates a graph where each node represents a function from the input dictionary, and directed edges
    represent dependencies between these functions. A dependency exists from node A to node B if the output of node A
    is required as an input to node B.

    Additionally, if a function has the `forced_nodes` attribute, extra edges are added based on the values in 
    `forced_nodes`. Specifically, if an entry in `forced_nodes` is a tuple of the form ("node", "another_node"), 
    an edge is added from `another_node` to the function's node.

    Args:
        nodes (Dict[str, Node]): 
            A dictionary where keys are the names of the nodes (functions), and values are the functions themselves. 
            Functions may have dependencies on other nodes, based on their input arguments.

        nx.DiGraph: 
            A directed acyclic graph (DAG) where the nodes are function names and the edges represent 
            input-output relationships between functions.
